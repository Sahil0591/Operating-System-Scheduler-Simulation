# Operating-System-Scheduler-Simulation
This project simulates and compares CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, FeedbackRR, IdealSJF, RR, SJF) under high-load, real-time, and mixed workloads. It evaluates performance metrics like turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and CPU utilization. A second-year project for the University of Sussex.
